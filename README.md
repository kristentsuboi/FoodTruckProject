# FoodTruckProject

# Overview
The purpose of the project is to take user input (name, type of food, rating) from the user. Once they finish inputting, prompt another menu that allows them to show all Foodtrucks, the average rating, the highest rating, or quit the program.

# Technologies Used
Java-OOP

# Lesson Learned
This project was definitely challenging. I struggled the most with ensuring that the loops weren't counting the FoodTruck objects that were empty. I included an if statement in my loops that asked if FoodTruck object didn't equal null, to do the action.

My main method runs a run method that asks for food truck input. When the user enters quit as a food truck name, it exits that menu and calls printMenu method which presents another menu asking the user to pick a number between 1-4 and performs the various tasks associated with those numbers. Methods were created for those tasks and those items were called if selected.
